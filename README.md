Overview of classical functional metrics and their effectiveness in measuring productivity for management or design quality of OO-systems. Verification methods for OO-software and how it differs from functional design testing. Maintenance and reuse issues.

## Course Overview
Object-oriented design and analysis emerged as a response to structured decomposition, popularized by the Xerox PARC work on Smalltalk in the 1970s, and has been the dominant programming paradigm since the 90s (Java, C++, Python, Objective C, and others are examples of OO languages). We will learn about what an "object-oriented approach" implies, compare it to other approaches (such as prototyping, functional programming, and imperative programming), and use OO to take a customer problem from poorly expressed requirements to working prototype.

After the course, students are able to:

* understand the difference between software programming and software engineering
* apply object-oriented design and analysis to common software problems and projects
* work together in teams, with modern(ish) software tools.

## Deliverables
The class will use [Github](https://github.com/SENG330-17) and [Slack](https://seng330-f17.slack.com). Students will have to register their Github username (either a permanent one or a throwaway) with the instructors. Those with an objection to using Github please contact the instructor for workarounds. All Github activity is private to the class organization. Please see the privacy notice on the Connex site.

[Slack](https://seng330-f17.slack.com) will be the primary mechanism used for communication in the class. My rationale (apart from being tools used in practice) is to expose the class as a whole to questions about assignment and lectures. 

University and department policies on professional conduct and integrity are applicable. Feel free to see me in person, or via UVic email, for personal questions.
