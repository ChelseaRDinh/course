# Catchup
- TAs
- Slack and Github
- has everyone got Eclipse and exercises from M0 working?
- walk thru Eclipse (eclEmma, checkStyle)

# Software Process
- Waterfall vs Agile 
- Cynefin

Key is to have a process, follow it, and reflect on the results. 

# Encapsulation
Picture of conk
What are some reasons to practice "information hiding"
The Design Space picture
- A class is two things: implementation and interface

# Types and Classes
Java has 8 primitive types: int, boolean, double, float, byte, char, long, short

What distinguishes a type in Java? In OO? A type is a set of externally visible characteristics (public). 

Is Java strongly or weakly typed? 
- what is the benefit of strongly typed? the disadvantage?

# Abstractions
- what are common abstractions? 
- goals for abstractions:
	- **clearly map to concepts in the problem domain (to facilitate program understanding)**
	- **be well-encapsulated (see above)**

# Problem abstraction
What are some important attributes of Books
	- Hardcover
	- paperback
	- formats
	- fiction/non-fiction
- Aside: design problems are the fun parts of software. Here you apply what you know and problem solve. 

# Playing Cards and Solitaire
- design problem: how can we represent a playing card?
	- "the 10 of Hearts"
	- for each Java example, "what is the abstraction"
	- Card1: neither encapsulated, nor good abstraction
	- **a bad idea to try to shoehorn domain concepts into default types like integer or string**
	- Card2: slightly better, because we cannot directly change/mutate the value 
	- Card3: information hiding. Also uses the notion of suits and ranks to capture the problem space.
	- Card4: the same, but now with a different implementation (hidden).
	- Card5: uses Enumerated Types

# Encapsulation principles. (So why do we care about these tings? )
* Make all fields private.
* Do not automatically supply a class with a "getter" (a.k.a. "accessor") and "setter" (a.k.a. "mutator") method for every field.
* Try to avoid defining methods that both change ("mutate") the state of an object and return ("access") a value.
* Define your instance variables as final whenever possible.
* Make your classes immutable whenever possible. 
* Ensure your accessor methods do not return a reference to a mutable instance variable.   S
