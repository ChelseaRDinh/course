# CRC cards exercise
Introduce CRC cards. Class-Responsibility-Collaborators. This is from Beck and Cunningham, “A Laboratory for Object Oriented Thinking”, OOPSLA 1989.

1. Class: the name of the class/object which we assign a role. Remember, OO is about communication between objects to get work done.
2. Responsibilities - problems to be solved. Aggregation of methods/messages.
3. Collaborators - objects sending or receiving messages to satisfy responsibilities

Use them with MVC example. We outlined the three cards.
- View - Render the Model & Transform Coordinates - Controller/Model
- Model - Maintain Problem info & Broadcast change notifications - Limited collab
- Controller - Interpret user input & Distribute control - View/Model

* Organize spatially to reflect design (groups and abstractions)
* Start with knowns, and work from there
* When a card is too crowded, move responsibilities to an unnamed card

Exercise: apply CRC cards in designing a system for a library management system. This is separate from the checkout and patron management code.
