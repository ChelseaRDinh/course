# Inversion of Control
- demo of Lucky Number
    + design problems without observer
    + separate :
        + program elements responsible for storing state, (a database, for example, and associated objects)
        + program elements responsible for viewing state, (a View, e.g. a web page or this UI)
        + program elements responsible for changing state (the commands sent by the user)
    - Observer pattern:
        + model uninterested in observers (what they do)
        + register / deregister as needed
        + IOC and callback approach

# Assignment 3 discussion
    - due date (before/after reading break)
    - work in teams of 2 (so relevant to due date)

# discussion of design flaws - previous notes
    + writing vs coding
    + UW examples
    + naming

# inversion of control and dependency injection (D in SOLID)
- something else controls the program flow (often a framework)
- graphic from notes
- [Observer/Observable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/Observable.html) interface in JDK
- Dependency Injection example  ([Guice](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation))
    -separate behaviour from dependency resolution
    + takes a set of components (classes + interfaces) 
    + Adds a set of configuration metadata
    + Provides the metadata to an injection framework
    + Bootstraps object creation with a configured injector (courtesy Reid Holmes)
    + See [CreditCard example](https://github.com/caplin/Guice-Example.git). Note: the Yahoo API does not work anymore.
- We could write unit tests as normal. Not always possible: charging CCs.
- We could use a Factory to offload dependency management.
- But then we are exposing dependencies directly, and Factories grow in number
- DI stage 1: introduce the dependencies as constructor params
    + but now clients are responsible for managing dependencies
- DI with Guice: use the framework to bind dependencies in a separate module.
- Note: the essential complexity of managing dependencies does not go away. But, we can reduce the accidental complexity by modularizing it into a single place.
